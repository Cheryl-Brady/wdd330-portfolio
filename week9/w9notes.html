        <u>Chapter 9 Summary - The Window Object</u><br>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>window</b> object is the global object in a browser.</li>
            <li>Global variables are actually properties of the window<br>
               object in a browser environment.</li>
            <li><b>alert , confirm() , and prompt()</b> are all methods of the<br>
               window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.</li>
            <li>The <b>window.navigator</b> object gives information about the user’s<br>
               browser and operating system, although it can be unreliable.</li>
            <li>The <b>window.location</b> object provides information about the URL<br>
               of the current page.</li>
            <li>The <b>window.history</b> object keeps information about the pages that<br>
               have been visited in the session.</li>
            <li>The <b>window.screen</b> object provides information about the user’s screen.</li>
            <li>document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.</li>
            <li>Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests<br>
               using the <b>document.cookie</b> property.</li>
            <li>The <b>window.setTimeout()</b> method can be used to invoke a function after a<br>
               set amount of time. It can be canceled using the <b>clearTimeout()</b> method.</li>
            <li>The <b>window.setInterval()</b> method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function.<br>
               It can be stopped using the <b>clearInterval()</b> method.</li>
            <li>The <b>window.requestAnimationFrame()</b> method can be used to produce smooth<br>
               and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities.<br>
                It can be canceled using the <b>cancelAnimationFrame()</b> method.</li>
        </ul>

      <u>Chapter 14 Summary - HTML API's</u>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a <br>
            variety of technologies, including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript.</li>  
          <li><b>data-</b> attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used<br>
             to enhance the user experience with JavaScript.<br>
            <i>a good example of this is in our Week 9 team activity</i></li>
          <li>The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a<br>
             similar way to cookies, but without the same storage restrictions.</li>
          <li>The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device,<br>
             as long as the user gives permission.</li>
          <li>The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background,<br>
             which helps to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.</li>
          <li>Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time,<br>
             two-way communication.</li>
          <li>The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.</li>
          <li>The <audio> and <video> elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips<br>
             in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.</li>
          <li>The <b>canvas</b> element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text,<br>
             and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.</li>
          <li>A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.</li>
        </ul>
