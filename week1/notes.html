    <h1>Week 1 - Notes</h1>

    <p>
        ** Doing Stuff with WebThings Reading Notes: <br>
        <br>
        <u>Steps to success:</u>
        <ol>
            <li>THINK - find out what you dont know and learn it by playing 
                with it (sandboxing).
            </li>
            <li>DESIGN - use what you have just learned to layout a solution 
                to the problem.
            </li>
            <li>TEST - Create a series of expectations for behavior that will 
                indicate if you have been successful.
            </li>
            <li>CREATE - Write the code!</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>JS Reminders:</u>
        <ul>
            <li>When you want to GET the user INPUT from any input or text area 
                tag, you use the word "value". <br>
                ex:  var storyName = document.getElementById("name_imput").value;
            </li>
            <li>To SHOW something to a user, you use a section and the word 
                "innerHTML". <br>
                ex:  document.getElementById("story_display").innerHTML = storyHTML; 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Local Storage:</u><br>
            Stores the value (key-value pairs) of a variable.<br>
            Its an associative array. <br>
            ex:  localStorage.setItem(storyName.storyHTML); <br>
            -OR- localStorage["all_customers"] = allCustomersString; <br>
            <br>
            -To retrieve or load from storage: <br>
            ex:  var storyHTML = localStorage.getItem(storyName); <br>
            -OR- var storedCustomersString = localStorage["all_customers"];
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Associate Arrays:</u><br>
            To represent a "thing" in JavaScript, or putting a list of 
            attributes inside a variable. <br>
            <br>
            ex:  var aName = { <br>
                    attributeType:attributeName,<br>
                    attributeType:attributeName,<br>
                    .<br>
                    .<br>
                    .<br>
                }<br>
                <br>
            The name of an associative array's attributeType is it's 
            "key" and the attributeName is called the "value" -- key-value pair.<br>
            <br>
            * Dont forget to put strings in " ".<br>
            ex:  "name":"Cheryl", <br>
                 "age":40;
    </p>

        ** Master Mobile UX - SitePoint Video<br>
        <br>
        *<u>Mobile 1st Design:</u><br>
        "Design for the smallest, least powerful device first... focus on content 
        and core functionality... This leads to simple, beautiful apps."
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Things to remember:</u><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Desktop computers have been declining since 2011.</li>
            <li>People are walking around with phones not laptops.</li>
            <li>Start small and scale up.</li>
            <li>Mobile is not a fad, its not going away.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Reachability matters:</u><br>
        75% of people use their thumbs to navigate their mobile device.  Keep 
        clickable items like menus in thumb reachable places (at the bottom).
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Speed matters:</u><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce img usage throughout sites/apps.</li>
            <li>SVG and Webfonts are lower bandwidth.</li>
            <li>Optimize and minify CSS and JS files.</li>
            <li>GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Design Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms:</u><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Use placeholder text in fields and then float the title.</li>
            <li>Use number pad pop up for entry in number only fields.</li>
            <li>Link phone numbers to make direct calls.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Design better advertising:</u><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Display smaller ads - make them bigger when clicked.</li>
            <li>Pop-ups and autoplay videos are despised - stop using them!</li>
            <li>Keep it simple and sleek, content should come first.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
